Hello, my name is Ali Heydari
And I want to create a platform that can be used by everyone
From the producer to the final buyer, which is the consumer.
So far there is nothing interesting and many small and big programs have these capabilities.
Big companies like Amazon and Alibaba and even big stores have their own suppliers and people also buy from these big stores and are happy with this purchase.
Something between traveling for fun and seeing various packages and buying products with competitive prices and quality that depend on their needs so that they can choose freely.
All these things are attractive and good until they realize that they can get the same product at a better price elsewhere.
It is from a place that does not exist yet and it is supposed to do this in a special and innovative way.
A few companions remain until the end.
If you don't know, there is no reason why it didn't happen.
